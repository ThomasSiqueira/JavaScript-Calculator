This project was made for learning and inproving front-end habilities. It is too a showcase project to show beginners level knowledge of front-end projects.

The project is a simple calculator that does basic mathematics operations. This seems at first a simple task, but even if the idea behind each operation is quite
simple the implementation is not, and a big amount of knowlegment in algorithms is necessary to finish the project.
